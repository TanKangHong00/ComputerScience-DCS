Note to instructors:

1. Tutor may need to teach IP addressing and Subnetting &VLSM in practical classes prior to lecture 
(please follow the Course Plan to conduct practical class). 
This is because E-Practical test (E-SBA) is on week 13. 

2. I will try my best to cover Chapter 8 topic in the lecture hall.  
I will update KL tutors about the progress of the lecture.  

3. From the subnetting workbook, tutors are required to assign different subnetting problem questions
 ( minimum 15 questions for Class A, B and C) to students.
 Students are required to submit their subnetting workbook exercise answers
 (handwritten answers) into Google Classroom.
