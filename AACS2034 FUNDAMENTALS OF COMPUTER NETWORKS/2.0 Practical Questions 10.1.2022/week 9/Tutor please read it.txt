Note to instructors:

1. Tutor may need to teach IP addressing and Subnetting &VLSM in practical classes prior to lecture (please follow the plan B-course plan). 
This is because Practical test is on week 13. 

2. I will try my best to cover Chapter 8 topic in the lecture hall.  I will update the KL tutor about the progress of the lecture.  

3. From the VLSM workbook, tutors are required to assign different VLSM problem questions 
( minimum 15 questions for Class A, B and C) to students.
 Students are required to submit their VLSM workbook exercise answers (handwritten answers) into Google Classroom.
